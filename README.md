Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.
graph traversal, such as depth first search or breadth first search. We start with one of the two nodes and, during traversal, check if the other node is found. We should mark any node found in the course of the algorithm as ¡®already visited¡¯ to avoid cycles and repetition of the nodes.
